# Running and Testing Your Application

Tizen Studio provides the following set of tools to help you run and test your Web application projects:

- [Web Simulator](web-simulator.md)

  You can run your Web application in a Google Chrome&trade; browser-based simulator, which provides many settings and features for debugging your application. You can test how the application behaves, and even send in events and messages.

- [Web Unit Testing Tool](web-unit-test-tool.md) **(Unit Testing Web Applications)**

  The unit test tool is used to ensure that the application runs properly as intended in the source code. You can create, edit, and run unit tests, and check and analyze the test results.
