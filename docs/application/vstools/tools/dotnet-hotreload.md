# What is Tizen .NET Hot Reload

With Hot Reload you can now modify your apps managed source code while the application is being debugged, without the need to stop and restart the debugging.
After starting the debugging of the application on the emulator or real device, you can apply the changed file without stopping the debugging of the application.
With "Hot Reload" changes are applied only on the second entrance to the function. If the change you made is supported your app will now be patched while its running with your new logic and you should see the changes in your appâ€™s behavior the next time the updated code is re-executed by either your action or by something like a timer triggering the code.

# Examples

## Tizen .NET Hot Reload without breakpoint

This example shows using Hot Reload in an Tizen ElmSharp based UI application.
Here, we are adding a callback method on button click event and once application is launched on target device and running in debug mode, we will modify the
callback method and do Ctrl+S (Save) to apply Hot Reload.

The following video demonstrates the same on Tizen Device:

## Tizen .NET Hot Reload with breakpoint
