# Tizen .NET Hot Reload

With Hot Reload you can now modify your apps managed source code while the application is being debugged, without the need to stop and restart the debugging.
After starting the debugging of the application on the emulator or real device, you can apply the changed file without stopping the debugging of the application.
With Hot Reload changes are applied only on the second entrance to the function. If the change you made is supported, your app will now be patched while it's running with your new logic. You should see the changes in your appâ€™s behavior the next time the updated code is re-executed by either your action or by a timer triggering the code.

## Examples

### Tizen .NET Hot Reload without breakpoint

The example shown here uses Hot Reload in a Tizen ElmSharp based UI application.
Here, we add a callback method on the button click event and once the application is launched on a target device and it is running in debug mode, we modify the callback method and Save (Ctrl+S) to apply Hot Reload.

The following video demonstrates the example on a Tizen device:

### Tizen .NET Hot Reload with breakpoint

The example shown here uses Hot Reload in a Tizen ElmSharp based UI application.
Here, we add a breakpoint in the main method on a static method call and once the application is launched on a target device and it is running in debug mode, we will modify the method and Save (Ctrl+S) to apply Hot Reload.
